This Python package provide a series of tools to integrate and query the genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and
clinical data (aka, the multi-omics data). With scalable data-frame manipulation tools, OpenOmics facilitates the common
coding tasks when preparing data for RNA-seq bioinformatics analysis.

- Free software: MIT license
- Documentation: https://openomics.readthedocs.io.

## Features

- Provides a bioinformatics workflow to generate integrative results from multi-omics data.
- Facilitates integration of various bio-databases, multi-omics expression, genomics, and clinical data.
- Highly flexible to different data types and missing data.
- Provides researchers with means to consistently store and explore their experimental datasets.
- Enables scalable performance with parallel computing, while easily configurable to deploy on both single machine and a
  cluster.
