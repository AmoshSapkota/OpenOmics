### How to change the download directory where database files are cached?

You can make the setting at `openomics.set_cache_dir(path="PATH/OF/YOUR/CHOICE/")` which will change the default
cache location. However, this setting doesn't persist across user sessions. You can also change the default cache
directory at a `~/.openomics/conf.json` to persist the setting for each user.
