# Installation

## Stable release

To install OpenOmics, run this command in your terminal:

    $ pip install openomics

This is the preferred method to install OpenOmics, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip` installed, it is recommended to install
the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to get started with Python 3.7, 3.8, or
3.9 on either Mac OS, Linux, or Windows.


## From sources

The sources for OpenOmics can be downloaded from the [Github repo](https://github.com/JonnyTran/OpenOmics).

You can either clone the public repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/JonnyTran/OpenOmics

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

    $ cd OpenOmics
    $ pip install ./ -e
