This Python package provide a series of tools to integrate and query the genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and
clinical data (aka, the multi-omics data). With scalable data-frame manipulation tools, OpenOmics facilitates the common
coding tasks when preparing data for RNA-seq bioinformatics analysis.


Features
--------

* Provides a bioinformatics workflow to generate integrative results from multi-omics data.
* Facilitates integration of various bio-databases, multi-omics expression, genomics, and clinical data.
* Highly flexible to different data types and missing data.
* Provides researchers with means to consistently store and explore their experimental datasets.
* Enables scalable performance with parallel computing, while easily configurable to deploy on both single machine and a cluster.
